# 🚨 Emergency Response USSD System

**Connecting disaster victims to life-saving resources through basic mobile phones**

## 🌍 The Problem

When disasters like floods hit communities in Nigeria, people are often stranded with limited communication options. While smartphones and internet may be unavailable, most people still have basic phones capable of SMS and USSD. This creates a critical gap in emergency response - how do we connect victims to available shelter, food, and transport when traditional communication channels fail?

## 💡 Our Solution

A USSD-based emergency response system that works on any mobile phone, even without internet connectivity. Users simply dial `*123#` and get instant access to:

- 🏠 **Emergency Shelter** - Find available accommodation
- 🍽️ **Food Distribution** - Locate food centers and kitchens  
- 🚗 **Transport Services** - Connect to evacuation and medical transport

## 🔧 How It Works

### For Disaster Victims:
1. **Dial `*123#`** on any mobile phone
2. **Select service type** (1=Shelter, 2=Food, 3=Transport)
3. **Enter location** (e.g., "Lokoja")
4. **Get matched** with nearest available resources
5. **Receive SMS confirmation** with contact details

### For Service Providers:
1. **Register resources** through web dashboard
2. **Update availability** in real-time
3. **Receive SMS alerts** when matched with requests
4. **Coordinate response** directly with victims

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
📱 Basic Phone (USSD) → 📡 Telecom Gateway → 🖥️ Flask Backend → 🗄️ Database
                                                     ↓
📱 SMS Notifications ← 📡 SMS Gateway ← 🔄 Matching Engine ← 📊 Admin Dashboard
```

### Core Components:

- **USSD Service**: Handles menu navigation and user sessions
- **Matching Engine**: Location-based resource allocation algorithm
- **SMS Service**: Confirmation and alert notifications
- **Admin Dashboard**: Resource management interface
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for integrations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask and dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hackathon

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

The system will start on `http://localhost:12000`

### Testing the USSD Flow

```bash
# Run the demo script
python demo.py

# Or test manually
python test_ussd.py
```

## 📱 USSD Menu Structure

```

```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Models:
- **User**: Phone number, name, location history
- **Resource**: Shelters, food centers, transport services
- **EmergencyRequest**: User requests and matching status
- **USSDSession**: Session state management

### Resource Types:
- `SHELTER`: Emergency accommodation facilities
- `FOOD`: Food distribution centers and kitchens
- `TRANSPORT`: Evacuation and medical transport

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### USSD Integration
- `POST /ussd/callback` - Telecom provider webhook
- `POST /ussd/test` - Testing endpoint

### Resource Management
- `GET /api/resources` - List all resources
- `POST /api/resources` - Add new resource
- `PUT /api/resources/{id}` - Update resource
- `GET /api/stats` - System statistics

### Admin Dashboard
- `GET /admin/` - Dashboard overview
- `GET /admin/resources` - Manage resources
- `GET /admin/requests` - View emergency requests
